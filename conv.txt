Hi.
I like my cat Mittens.
Mr. Dahlem keeps telling us to program.

Hidey-ho!
What's up?
Who are you?
What do you know?
I know all the state capitals.
I like vegetables smothered in cheese.
I want to build a robot.
I want to understand French.
Do you like me?
You confuse me.
I want fried chicken.
I like you.
Bye
